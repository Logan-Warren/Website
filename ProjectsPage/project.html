                    <p>Our ASL Letter Recognition web application is designed to recognize 
                        American Sign Language (ASL) letters in real-time from live video input. 
                        The application works by taking in live video footage from the device's webcam of the user's hands, 
                        processing it using a neural network that we have trained to 75% accuracy, and then writing the 
                        corresponding ASL letter on the screen.
                    <br><br>
                    To train our model, we used over 25,000 pictures of ASL letters. We created tensors using TensorFlow, 
                    which is an open-source machine learning library developed by Google, and then used these tensors to input into our model. 
                    By training our model on this data, it was able to learn the patterns and features that are specific to each letter in the ASL alphabet.
                    <br><br>
                    Once our model has been trained, we integrated it into our web application 
                    using TensorFlow.js. TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library that allows us to 
                    run machine learning models directly in the browser, without the need for any 
                    server-side processing. This means that our ASL Letter Recognition application can run entirely on the 
                    client-side, making it fast and responsive.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, our ASL Letter Recognition web application is a powerful tool for helping people 
                    communicate more effectively with those who use ASL. It is a proof of concept for deeper and more 
                    complex ASL to be translated almost instantly. By leveraging the power of machine learning and deep 
                    learning algorithms, we are able to create an application that is highly accurate and responsive,
                    making it easy for anyone to use.
